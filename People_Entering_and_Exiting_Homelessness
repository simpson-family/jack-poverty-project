# People Entering Homlessness and Exitung Homelessness

Unfortunately all the work that people are putting in isn’t enough to stop poverty in itself. In the USA between 2013 and 2020, 908,530 people entered homelessness, but only 900,895 left it. That means that homelessness is still growing,  like how in Vermont the homeless population that joined schools has more than doubled since 2019-2020. Which is especially bad since homelessness and poverty can make people more likely to abuse substances. It also means people have less healthcare and are more likely to have disorders, such as major depression disorder, which is twice as likely in homeless women than women with homes. In the end poverty is bad in small amounts, but is even worse since it’s still growing.
