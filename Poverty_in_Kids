Did you know that there is also a lot of homelessness in young kids? An astronomical 1.6 million kids are homeless just in the United States, that’s 1 in every 45 kids. And almost as astonishing is that 16 million kids are in poverty. Closer to home, the percentage of homeless children in Vermont that have been fed has almost doubled from 2023 to 2024. And without enough money to live on, kids sometimes can’t go to school because they have to work to earn money. Now you know why homelessness isn’t just bad for adults, it’s also bad for kids.
