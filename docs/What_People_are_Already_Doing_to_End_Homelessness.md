# What People are Already Doing to End Homelessness
Everyone can work to end poverty. Organizations can do a lot of work by themselves. For example, over the last year, the John Graham Shelter has given people housing and/or services, 43% of which were children under 17, and 23% were 60 or more. They also let 117 people live in the John Graham shelter, and 4578 people got bed-nights or free shelter. The government has pitched in too. It has worked together with different companies and people to mitigate homelessness. It has also tried to convince leaders of local and state governments to do what works to stop homelessness. Lastly, they told people what homelessness is.  Even people like me and you can do their part to end homelessness. A few of the things you could do to stop homelessness is by stopping it before it starts, giving homeless people homes, getting more high paying jobs, not discriminating, donating to local causes, and finally, by figuring out what helps homeless people, and sharing it. That is how different groups and individuals have helped to mitigate homelessness. and what you yourself can do to stop homelessness.
