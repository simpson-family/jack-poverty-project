Unfortunately, not everyone has a home to feel safe. And some people even blame them for being homeless. But that\u2019s not all, not having a home can make people likely to use drugs and be sick, which can cause missed school and job chances. And without school, it can be harder for people to make good decisions and get good jobs, which can lead to generational poverty. Luckily governments, businesses, and even people like me and you are helping out every day to end poverty.</p> <p>Homelessness is a problem, it can hurt anyone, from toddlers to grandparents. And every single one has suffered some kind of loss. Kids can\u2019t go to school, parents can have disorders, and grandparents have less healthcare. And yes, it hurts everyone, but it always seems to focus on specific people, because of their race, gender, nationality, wealth, or even their disabilities. And that\u2019s not chance, that is because of people, people that try to make it harder for other people to survive in this world. So if you really want a way to help, then don\u2019t care what disabilities or differences someone might have, don\u2019t think of homelessness as a crime. If someone is struggling to get a house in this world, you should do whatever you can to help them. You may think you need your money and other people's support, but they need it more.</p>"},{"location":"The_Causes_of_Homelessness/","title":"The Causes of Homelessness","text":"<p>There are also a large number of reasons why this is happening. The most common reason why people are evicted is because of an immediate and catastrophic change. That can happen because of death, loss of relationship and more. You can also be evicted because of abuse, did you know 90% of homeless women say they were abused. Lastly, it can happen because of generational poverty, which is when poverty is passed down from generation to generation. 45% of people who spend half or more of their childhood in poverty are poor by 35. If they spend less than half of their childhood, they only have an 8% chance. And those are just some of the reasons why people can be evicted.</p>"},{"location":"The_Effects_of_Homelessness/","title":"The Effects of Homelessness","text":"<p>There are many reasons why it is such a tragedy to be homeless. Firstly, it can affect people not only physically, but mentally to. For example, being homeless can lead to higher amounts of substance abuse. It can also make it harder to come out of homelessness, because if your homeless, you have less healthcare, which can lead to missed school and job chances. It can also make you more likely to have a mental illness, and mental illnesses can make you more likely become homeless. Because of that, 47% of homeless women are suffering from major depression disorder, which is twice the normal amount. Those are just some of the many ways that homelessness can be hard on people's body and mind.</p>"},{"location":"What_People_are_Already_Doing_to_End_Homelessness/","title":"What People are Already Doing to End Homelessness","text":"<p>Everyone can work to end poverty. Organizations can do a lot of work by themselves. For example, over the last year, the John Graham Shelter has given people housing and/or services, 43% of which were children under 17, and 23% were 60 or more. They also let 117 people live in the John Graham shelter, and 4578 people got bed-nights or free shelter. The government has pitched in too. It has worked together with different companies and people to mitigate homelessness. It has also tried to convince leaders of local and state governments to do what works to stop homelessness. Lastly, they told people what homelessness is.  Even people like me and you can do their part to end homelessness. A few of the things you could do to stop homelessness is by stopping it before it starts, giving homeless people homes, getting more high paying jobs, not discriminating, donating to local causes, and finally, by figuring out what helps homeless people, and sharing it. That is how different groups and individuals have helped to mitigate homelessness. and what you yourself can do to stop homelessness.</p>"}]}
